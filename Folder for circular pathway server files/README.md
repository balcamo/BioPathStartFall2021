# BioPath: Tool For Learning BioChemistry

BioPath is a web application with the purpose of serving as a tool to teach students about biochemistry. The current iteration of BioPath includes animations depicting chemical pathways inside the body and how the various elements inside those pathways interact with each other.

## Documentation

We created a [wiki](https://github.com/zmckee2/BioPath_SeniorDesign/wiki) page containing documentation for this web application.
More detailed documentation can be found in the guide we provided (it's like a 60+ page pdf doc).
